# Book-Recommender
In this notebook, we implemented a book recommender system based on the collaborative filtering algorithm using Panda and Numpy libraries and the Tensorflow framework.

We used [this](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset) dataset from Kaggle for this project. Notice that the CSV files in the `reduced-data` folder 
are not the original data files because the original files are too heavy to process, and probably you will face hardware problems processing the whole data.

Feel free to contribute to this project and share your ideas with me :)
